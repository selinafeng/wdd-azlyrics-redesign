## Hello!!
### Before you push your code to GitHub, make sure to do these things:
1. Make sure you're on your own branch. If you're not, enter `git checkout <your-branch-name>`
2. `git pull`
3. `git add .`
4. `git commit -m "add some descriptive commit message here"`
5. `git push`

### Remember: do NOT push directly to the master branch! If you have any errors, let me know!
